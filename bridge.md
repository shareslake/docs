# How to move Redeemable from Cardano mainnet to Shareslake mainnet

In order to create a smooth transition from of Redeemable from Cardano mainnet to Shareslake mainnet we setup a bridge.

Shareslake addresses are fully compatible with Cardano addresses. That means you can use the same wallet / key pair to create transactions in both networks maintaining the same address.

We had to stop the bridge due to some issues and we are working on a second version fixing reliability problems and adding extra features for a better user experience.

In the meanwhile, if you want to move your Redeemable from Cardano to Shareslake you can follow these steps:

1. Send your Redeemable tokens (in Cardano network) to the following address: `addr1qypfxe56p0r3f0js5cav4jzja7qqedwfd888p6z9kxxs64cmth3jzw7y6ex4hxv9j4uj2e37ael8207rd2zfhjnnpukqy382j8`.

2. Send us a message through the `bridge` channel of our discord [server](https://discord.gg/Ds6XVSNFBq).

3. A Shareslake member will take care of sending you the equivalent Redeemable through Shareslake network.
