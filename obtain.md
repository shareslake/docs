# Obtaining Redeemable - The Shareslake's base coin

Redeemable (RED) currently lives in both Cardano and Shareslake networks.

The easiest way to obtain it is to previously own ADA on Cardano mainnet. Once you have some ADA, exchanging it by Redeemable is a trivial process described [here](https://www.shareslake.com/?preview_id=891&preview_nonce=f6e3f6c407&_thumbnail_id=-1&preview=true#pre-sale).

Once you have Redeemable in the Cardano mainnet you can move it to Shareslake mainnet following [this guide](bridge.md).
