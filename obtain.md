# Obtaining Redeemable - The Shareslake's base coin

Redeemable (RED) currently lives in both Shareslake and Cardano. With the time, we will take Redeemable to more networks.

Redeemable allows people to get rid of crypto volatility at the same time than they protect from fiat inflation. Redeemable users preserve their purchasing power over time. Redeemable is NOT a 1:1 pegged stablecoin nor a usual cryptocurrency, it is a new concept of coin.

## Interacting with the reserve

To obtain Redeemable by putting USD into the reserve, or redeem USD from the reserve by burning Redeemable, you have to connect your wallet to the Shareslake's dashboard. Into the dashboard you just need to follow the steps and, at the next epoch boundary, your Redeemable will be issued to your wallet (redemptions do not need to wait until the epoch boundary). The epoch boundary happens every 3 days, so the maximum time you will need to wait for your Redeemable to appear into your wallet is 3 days. Once you have Redeemable in your wallet, transactions take just some seconds to be processed by the network.

Currently, the wallets supporting Shareslake are:

The dashboard is pending to be released yet. We will make an announcement once released.

## Using decentralized exchanges

Since Redeemable lives in Cardano and Shareslake you can exchange RED by other Cardano tokens when they are available in Cardano DEXes such as [Muesliswap](https://muesliswap.com/) or [SundaeSwap](https://sundaeswap.finance/).

If you plan to make simple transactions with RED, or just hold it, we recommend to move it to Shareslake network instead of maintaining the Cardano tokens. In this way, you protect yourself from any possible minting issues or security breaches in the bridge. Learn more about the Shareslake's multi-chain bridge security on [this post](https://blog.shareslake.com/shareslake-bridge/).

Once you have Redeemable tokens in Cardano you can move them to Shareslake following [this guide](bridge.md).
